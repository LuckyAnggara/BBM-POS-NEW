# Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform Transformation - Product Requirements Document

## Feature Name
Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform Transformation for BBM POS

## Epic
**Epic:** SaaS Platform Architecture and Multi-Tenancy Implementation
- [Implementation Summary](./IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- [Database Schema Changes](./DATABASE_SCHEMA_CHANGES.md)
- [API Documentation](./SAAS_API_DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Goal

### Problem
BBM POS was originally designed as a multi-branch application where a single organization could manage multiple retail locations. However, this architecture limited scalability and revenue opportunities as each deployment required separate infrastructure and maintenance. The system lacked:
- Ability to serve multiple independent organizations
- Subscription-based revenue model
- Self-service customer onboarding
- Centralized platform management and support

### Solution
Transform BBM POS into a comprehensive multi-tenant SaaS platform where multiple independent organizations (tenants) can use the same application instance while maintaining complete data isolation. Each tenant operates independently with their own branches, users, and data, while sharing the same codebase and infrastructure.

### Impact
- **Revenue Growth**: Enable subscription-based recurring revenue model
- **Scalability**: Serve unlimited organizations on shared infrastructure
- **Operational Efficiency**: Centralized platform management and support
- **Market Expansion**: Self-service onboarding enables rapid customer acquisition
- **Cost Optimization**: Shared infrastructure reduces per-customer costs
